# CO2-emission

**This repository was taken from an assignment I did on Coursera.org platform:  
Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python**

**Project aim:**  
* Find two or more datasets on the web which are related
* Visualize the datasets to answer a question with the broad topic of **economic activity or measures**  
* When visualising the data, incorporate principles such as having as high data-ink ratio (Tufte) and  
aligning with Cairoâ€™s principles of truth, beauty, function, and insight. 

**Project summary:**
The data I chose to use were collected from https://data.worldbank.org.  
In particular I decided to show the carbon dioxide emission in the 5 countries with the world's biggest economy  
(USA, Japan, China, Germany and Great Britain) from 1960 until 2014.
