# Before working on this assignment please read these instructions fully. In the submission area,
# you will notice that you can click the link to **Preview the Grading** for each step of the assignment.
# This is the criteria that will be used for peer grading. Please familiarize yourself with the criteria before beginning the assignment.
#
# This assignment requires that you to find **at least** two datasets on the web which are related,
# and that you visualize these datasets to answer a question with the broad topic of **economic activity or measures**
# (see below) for the region of **None, None, United Kingdom**, or **United Kingdom** more broadly.
#
#
# As this assignment is for the whole course, you must incorporate principles discussed in the first week,
# such as having as high data-ink ratio (Tufte) and aligning with Cairoâ€™s principles of truth, beauty, function, and insight.
# 
# Here are the assignment instructions:
#
#  * State the region and the domain category that your data sets are about (e.g., **None, None, United Kingdom**
# and **economic activity or measures**).
#  * You must state a question about the domain category and region that you identified as being interesting.
#  * You must provide at least two links to available datasets. These could be links to files such as CSV or Excel files,
# or links to websites which might have data in tabular form, such as Wikipedia pages.
#  * You must upload an image which addresses the research question you stated. In addition to addressing the question,
# this visual should follow Cairo's principles of truthfulness, functionality, beauty, and insightfulness.
#  * You must contribute a short (1-2 paragraph) written justification of how your visualization addresses
# your stated research question.
#
# What do we mean by **economic activity or measures**?  For this category you might look at the inputs or outputs
# to the given economy, or major changes in the economy compared to other regions.
